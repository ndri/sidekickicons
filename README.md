Fanmade icons to complement [Heroicons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons).

Heroicons is amazing, but it doesn't have some icons I need. I've been creating these missing icons myself so they share a similar style, size and naming scheme.

Unfortunately, I can't contribute these icons to the Heroicons repository. From the README:

> We're not accepting contributions for new icons [...]. Instead we encourage you to release your own icons in your own library [...].

So I am sharing these icons in my own library as a Sidekick to the Hero.
